# Designer's Den - Structural Engineering Game

Welcome to Designer's Den, an educational game developed as part of my Master's thesis in Structural Engineering. This game aims to provide an interactive and engaging learning experience for students studying structural mechanics and statics.

## About the Game

Designer's Den is a web-based game developed using Angular and TypeScript with the help of KaboomJS. It incorporates game-based learning principles to teach and reinforce fundamental concepts in structural engineering. The game features various levels, each corresponding to a specific course within structural mechanics offered at NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Players solve tasks, analyze structures, and apply their knowledge to progress through the game.

## Master's Thesis

This game is the outcome of my Master's thesis, titled "Game-Based Learning in Structural Engineering Education." In this thesis, I explore the effectiveness of game-based learning as a tool to enhance student engagement and comprehension in structural engineering education. The thesis delves into the design process, pedagogical considerations, game mechanics, and evaluation of the game.
